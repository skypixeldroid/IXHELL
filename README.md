# IXHELL. A literal cheat code for online homework.

I've just spent about 2 months making this script, which helps people automatically do IXL. IXL is often used by teachers/parents to assign homework, and I was a victim. I hate it SO much, that I compiled this because no one had a working script to do this. Enjoy!

# How does it work? Is it patchable by IXL?
Short Answer: No. It cannot be patched by IXL.
Long Answer: No. It cannot be patched by IXL because my script uses Tesserat's OCR (Optical Charecter Recognition) to grab all text off of a certain area of the screen, then uses Aria/ChatGPT to solve it, then copy and paste the answer with PyAutoGUI

# How do I install it?
Simple Steps:
1. Download Opera (If you haven't)
2. Download Python (Version 3.xx At least)
3. Install PyAutoGUI (<code>pip install PyAutoGUI</code>)
